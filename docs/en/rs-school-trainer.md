## RS School Trainer

RS School Trainers are practicing developers from different companies and countries.

## How can I become an RS School trainer?

Any RS School mentor or activist of can try on the role of a coach. To begin with, it is a good practice to give a lecture within "Offline stream" or speak at the meetup. Preparation and giving out new assignments for students of the school is a good option, too, as it includes not only the preparation of the technical task but also the conduct of at least 2 webinars (assignment and answers to questions, summing up).

# General information for trainers

## Tasks

All theoretical lectures / materials should go along with assignments or evident application in practice.
Students usually start with the task, not a theory. And if they cannot solve the problem, they study the theory. Isolated abstract knowledge is almost not needed (except for fundamental). If students can solve a task without theory, they do not need it.

### Task presentation requirements:

- Deadline of tasks in the format - 11:59 p.m. 03/03/2016. Deadlines are only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, that is, on days when there are no lectures.
- Tasks must be added to the course schedule.
- Tasks should be well-defined (details on browser support, what and how to resize, scroll, etc.).
- Information on how to hand over the task (where and how to upload it, etc.).
- If you specify any details of the task, please do not forget to add these details to the description, not just drop them into the general chat.

### Theoretical tasks requirements

- No more than 2 hours of theory for each lesson. Theoretical knowledge should be covered by practice - task, test or other activity. Everything that is put into practice is quickly forgotten.
- Offline time should include 1-2 breaks
- Remove all unnecessary information from presentations. All the main links that can be  useful for further reading on the topic should be given at the end of the presentation
- Before giving the presentation, omit all materials / slides that are out of date. For example, nobody is interested in layout features for IE6 or handling memory leaks in IE8
- The turned on webcam at webinars makes the lecture more cordial
- During offline classes, communicate with the entire audience, and not with the front rows
- It is recommended to use contrasting colors in the presentation, as all lectures are shown to the audience on the projector
- For specific and rarely used things, it is better to leave a link to the material, do not describe them in detail
- Make more simple slides rather than one huge
- To present an API analysis of any functionality, it is better to organize workshops, not just enumerate them

### Organizing offline classes

We are constantly looking for those who want to conduct face-to-face lectures, student meetings, beerjs, office tours, etc. At the face-to-face event, you can give a lecture from the RS School curriculum - [https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/lectures](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/lectures) or just talk about working on a project, passing interviews, etc.

Venue: you can use any meeting room available for you by booking it yourself. If a list of listeners is required to access the meeting room, we will provide it.

Number of students: depends on the room.

If you decide to conduct an offline lesson, contact Ksyusha (Discord: sonejka, Telegram: @ s0nejka).
