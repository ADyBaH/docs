### Question: what to do if I can't get the course project done on time/ planning to overdue it for a couple days?
Answer: You should notify a mentor who has been assigned for the final task review. Algorithm is simple:
1. Create a Pull Request in any case
2. Describe in detail your situation in Pull Request text (it's preferable to include it at the beginning and to visually highlight it). Leave your contacts if it is necessary.
