## The Rolling Scopes

The Rolling Scopes is an independent international community of developers (mainly JavaScript / Front-end / iOS / Android), founded in 2013 in Minsk. Today many developers around the world know about us and participate in our projects and events.

## The Rolling Scopes meetups

Our meetings are not only a communication, exchange of experience and knowledge, but also a platform where anyone can try himself as a speaker, regardless of experience and topic. We help beginning speakers with topic selection, presentation preparation, and rehearsals. We have conducted about 60 free meetings in different cities for 6 years. Do you want to speak at a meeting? Just email us at rolling.scopes@gmail.com

## RS Summer Summit

Summer community summits are XXXL meetings :) They last for 2-3 days, in several streams, with a huge number of reports, workshops and are free for visitors.

## The Rolling Scopes conferences

Every year we organize a huge 2-3 day conference in Belarus, dedicated to web development, design and mobile app development. In 2019, https://rsconf.by was visited by 55+ speakers and 1000+ participants from 15 countries.

## JS Dev Day

Every year in the last week of May, we organize Javascript Developer Day, where we get together and participate in the quiz. People all over the world can join us. It is necessary just to find a company and a venue (and it does not matter whether it is a small room in the office or reserved tables in the pub). Our community provides all the materials for free and assists in the preparation. In 2019, Javascript Developer Day was celebrated in 24 cities.

## RS School

These are free courses conducted by our community since 2013. Everyone can study at RS School, regardless of age, employment and location. The training involves developers from different companies and countries. In our courses we combine online and offline learning. A new class of students starts every six months and is joined by about 2,000 people. 250+ mentors help our students to learn in comfort. Mentors of the school - our "iron" people - teach students in their free time and for free! Now courses are available for residents of Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Poland.
