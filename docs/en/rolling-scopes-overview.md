## The Rolling Scopes
The Rolling Scopes is an independent international community of developers (mainly JavaScript / Front-end / iOS / Android), founded in 2013 in Minsk. Today many developers around the world know about us and participate in our projects and events.

## The Rolling Scopes meetups
Our meetings are not only communication, the exchange of experience and knowledge, but also a platform where anyone can try himself as a speaker, regardless of experience and topic. We help beginning speakers with topic selection, presentation preparation, and rehearsal. For 6 years, we have conducted about 60 free meetings in different cities. Do you want to speak at a meeting? Just email us at rolling.scopes@gmail.com

## RS Summer Summit
Summer community summits are XXXL meetings :) They last 2-3 days, in several streams, with a huge number of reports, workshops and are free for visitors.
The Rolling Scopes conferences
Every year we organize the largest 2-3 day conference in Belarus dedicated to web development, design and mobile application development. In 2019, https://rsconf.by was visited by 55+ speakers and 1000+ participants from 15 countries.

## JS Dev Day
Every year in the last week of May, we organize Javascript Developer Day, where we get together and participate in the quiz. Anyone worldwide can join us. You should only find a company and a venue (and it does not matter whether it is a small office in the office or tables in the pub). Our community provides all materials for free and assists in the preparation. In 2019, Javascript Developer Day was celebrated in 24 cities.

## RS School
These are free courses conducted by our community since 2013. Everyone can study at RS School, regardless of age, professional employment and place of residence. The training involves developers from various companies and countries. In our courses we combine online and offline learning. A new class of student starts every six months and is joined by about 2,000 people. 250+ mentors help our students to learn in comfort.
