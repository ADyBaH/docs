## RS School Certificate

At students’ request, we do not issue certificates on a massive scale and set a threshold for each course.

Usually the passing score totals 55% of the best result on the course. For example, the best student scores 1884 points, 0.55 * 1884 ~ = 1000. Thus, the passing score is 1000.

### Minimum requirements for obtaining a certificate

* `CoreJS Interview` score - 4+
* Total passing score – 1000

### Task retaking for obtaining a certificate

To obtain a certificate, you can retake/submit the missing tasks. Contact @davojta on Discord.

To obtain a certificate 2019q3 class can submit the following tasks:

* Fancy - weather (first big task)
