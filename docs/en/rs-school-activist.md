## RS Activist
### Who is RS Activist?
RS Activist is a student in the current or previous class who actively helps other students to learn.
The examples of such help:
•	The easiest option is to answer other students’ questions in community chats. The etiquette rule- if somebody helped you to deal with the problem, write thanks to the #gratitude channel. Remember to google before asking any questions.
•	Taking lecture notes and posting them in the #materials channel Example
•	A detailed analysis of some problems associated with the task of the school:
o	As a podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_lapUSuu0&feature=youtu.be
o	As an article https://gist.github.com/uniorunr/112975fb69ccd2b1a8731a5f5daaced0
•	Analyzing your task solution if the mentor has given the maximum possible score for it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_phuaJ5ZNM&feature=youtu.be
•	Organizing face-to-face meetings of students:
o	Learning English (speaking club)
o	Task Discussion
o	Meet for a beer and make acquaintance
•	Preparing online tests based on the materials of past lectures. Example - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/issues/50
•	Helping with registration of tasks, documentation. For example - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/pull/53
•	There may be your example :)
