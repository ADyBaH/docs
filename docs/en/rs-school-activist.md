## RS Activist

### Who is RS Activist?
RS Activist is a student in the current or previous school enrollment who is actively helping other students to study.

The examples of such help:

1. The easiest option is to answer other studentsâ€™ questions in community chats. The etiquette rule - if somebody helped you to solve the problem, write thanks in the #gratitude channel. However, before asking any questions, please google it first.
2. Taking lecture notes and posting them in the #materials channel [Example](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s368/client/snv?noteGuid=b1359883-2b9e-419a-b9de-dd959fc05f05&noteKey=97c0f19486d851b3&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs368%2Fsh%2Fb1359883-2b9e-419a-b9de-dd959fc05f05%2F97c0f19486d851b3&title=Git)
