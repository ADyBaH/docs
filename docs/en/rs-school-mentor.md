### Gentleman's agreement

Mentors have the priority right to hire the students they teaching to their company / project / team.

### What does mentoring mean?

* Weekly meetings of the mentor with his group of students (on Skype, Google Hangouts, Telegram, Slack, etc.)
* Mentor answers students' questions, helps with tasks if possible
* Mentor checks and evaluates students' work through a review of the corresponding Pull Request students (about 7 works under stage # 2). As a result, each student’s PR contains the mentor’s comments on the code, recommendations and a final grade. The grade is given by the mentor based on the assessment criteria specified for each assignment. After checking, the mentor records the score in the Score form, on the basis of which the Public Score is generated.
* The mentor conducts training interviews (two for each student)
* The mentor can give additional lectures at his wish
* One mentor can teach from 2 to 6 students (at his wish)
  
### Possible additional activities for mentors. Only at the mentor’s wish :)

* Offline lectures in your city (offline streams)
* Conducting webinars, hosting YouTube Live events
* Preparation and conduct of tasks / tests.
* Application development and school utilities
* Hiring mentor’s students to his company
* Writing articles for the school blog [https://medium.com/rs-school/](https://medium.com/rs-school/)
* Mentoring students on their pet projects after the third stage of training
* Other

### Basic rules for the students and mentors interaction

* Communication is initiated by the student. The student should be motivated to study.
* The mentor must check the students’ work within 1-2 weeks.
* The checking of the work is carried out through a review of the corresponding Pull Requests
* Students ask most of the questions in corresponding Discord channels, not their mentor. [Learn more about Discord channels organization.](discussion-rules.md)

### How can a mentor organize interaction with students effectively?

* Schedule weekly meetings. The meeting format is "1-by-1" or general. Duration 30-60 minutes. Add a meeting to your calendar and students’ calendars.
* Before calling, view the open Pull Requests of the student(s). Leave your comments. Each PR should have at least three of your comments.
* During the call, discuss comments / suggestions, rate, answer current questions, give recommendations on the following tasks.
* Mentors can team up and mentor students together. In this case, students are still attached to a specific mentor, but the mentors of students in a team can check students’ tasks at their convenience. For example, check assignments and hold meetings in turn.
  
### Mentors’ Deadlines

Student deadlines are indicated in the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c1mN27MqQz7T8DcD_tMwkOSbizu3VFHXGf0eXwW7WGw/edit#gid=0). It is expected that the mentor checks the student's work within 1-2 weeks after the student submits the task.

### Pay it forward

The school works on the principle of "Pay it forward". According to this principle, we expect students who studied at our school for free to come back as mentors to pass on their knowledge to the next generation of students.
