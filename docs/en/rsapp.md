What should I do if something does not work in RS APP?
1. First check if someone already described this problem at https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues. If the problem is described, you just need to leave a comment in the corresponding issue stating that the problem is relevant for you as well. If there is no similar problem, go to step 2.
2. Ask about the problem in the corresponding discord channel (all tasks have their own channel). Wait for the response of other students / activists. If the problem is not solved, go to step 3.
3. Ask about the issue in the # questions-to-rsapp discord channel. Wait for comments from activists / admins. If the problem is not solved, go to step 4.
4. Create a new issue with a description of the problem in the repository https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues
Typical problems and solutions
1. No access to the course, error "No access"
Solution: register for the desired course using the link https://app.rs.school/registry/student
2. I do not know how to view my mistakes in a task with automatic check (Auto-test)
Solution: go to https://app.rs.school/ and go to the Auto-test section, and select the task of interest in the drop-down list. Verification details will be displayed in the Details column of the Verification Results table:
3. I passed the task and got points, but there are no changes in my score.
Solution: wait. It takes a little time for the changes to display - usually it takes 5 minutes.
