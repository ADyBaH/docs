# Chat Rules
## Main chat may be found at [Discord](https://discord.gg/bek4WMb)

## Rules  
* Official Languages: EN, BE, RU.  
* Your Discord username must include your GitHub username. For example, like this: “Paval Miatlitski (@pavalEscoba)”
* Each channel is intended to discuss only the subject specified in its name, for example, **#live-coding** must be used __only__. for the discussions concerning live streams Off-top messages will be deleted. Particular channels to be used during the course are further detailed below. 
* Make active use of search and pinned messages.  
* When answering any questions/messages, it is recommended to mention relevant users (@nicknamehere) by typing out their name, having a selection menu pop up or right click the user and select "Mention".  
* Be polite, don’t troll, and everything will be OK.  

## Categories
1. Chat channels are grouped by category.
2. Every time a new group of students starts the course, a new separate category in Discord is created. For example, students who have enrolled for the `RSSchool 2019Q1` course should use the `RS2019Q1` channel
3. The relevant category is created with the start of the enrollment period.
4. Discord allows collapsing any category and muting any channel.
5. Every channel in a category has a meaningful channel name — a kind of a short reference to what this particular channel is about

## Chat Map 
### `RS2019Q1` Category
- **#announcements** - This channel is used for making any announcements, any important notes regarding the educational process, postponing lessons, and giving new assignments. Any questions regarding the announcements should be addressed to the #questions channel. We recommend to enable “new messages” notifications in the above channel using the channel settings.   
- **#questions** - questions not related to the solution of tasks.
- **#live-coding** - communication during webinars and live broadcasts
